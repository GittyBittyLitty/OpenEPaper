## History

This was one of the tags reverse engineered by [Dmitry Grinberg](https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&proj=29.%20eInk%20Price%20Tags) who's code is the basis of the OpenEPaperLink project.

This tag has been somewhat readily available for some time and multiple DIY projects have used it successfully.  

At the moment (Feb 2024) the tag is still available from multiple vendors on ebay.  

Several of the ads have been active for several months and ads with higher asking prices for multiple years.  

Even the higher priced units aren't completely outrageous ($44) but are close to the price of a new display from Waveshare.  

This tag is no longer in production, it was replaced by the Chroma 74 H+ which has a higher resolution screen and a more modern SOC.  

From outward appearances the old and tags are identical.
