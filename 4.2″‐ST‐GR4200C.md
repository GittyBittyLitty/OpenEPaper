# Programming #

This ESL does not expose an SPI interface on its PAD. The CC2630 is programmable by UART given this is not disabled in the CCFG (Customer Configuration) settings.

To read/write flash you need to pull the 'D/L' pin to low on reset to get the Bootloader. I did so with connecting
DTR to D/L and RTS to Reset and then use: https://github.com/wirenboard/wb-cc2652p-flasher to read out the first 128kByte of the address space using an 3.3V USB UART.
