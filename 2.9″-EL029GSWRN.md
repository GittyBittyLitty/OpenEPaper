# SoC and Debug pinouts #
To program or read-out this tag you have two options:
* Enter the bootloader and communicate with the IC through UART. I'm having problems with this option, even though the MCU seams to run the bootloader, it starts sending garbage in UART as soon as I power it on with the EPD_RST pin shorted to ground (I assume that it is the configured pin to trigger the bootloader)
* Or with a cJTAG compliant programmer/debugger . I don't have one yet, because those are still pretty rare and as a result pretty expensive (the cheapest one and so the most useless one is 30$ from TI, quite something for a student;) )
